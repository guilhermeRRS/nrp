An approach to deal with a mathematical model for the Nurse Roastering Problem

This code intends to help the study of the Nurse Rostering Problem. Here it is possible to collect the data avaiable in http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/nrp/
and is implemented the model proposed by Tim Curtois, Rong Qu [http://www.schedulingbenchmarks.org/papers/computational_results_on_new_staff_scheduling_benchmark_instances.pdf],
rewritten by Erfan Rahimian, Kerem Akartunah, John Levine [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221716307822].

Feel free to reuse the code and improve it, correcting unecessary imports, variables and change the solver. If possible, share the improvements made so it may help other people who
are also studying the problem :)
